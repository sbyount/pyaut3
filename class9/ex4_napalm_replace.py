4. Replace Operations

4a. Add nxos1 to your my_devices.py file. Ensure that you include the necessary
information to set the NX-API port to 8443. This is done using 'optional_args'
in NAPALM so you should have the following key-value pair defined:
â€‹"optional_args": {"port": 8443}

4b. Create a new function named 'create_checkpoint'. Add this function into your
my_functions.py file. This function should take one argument, the NAPALM
connection object. This function should use the NAPALM _get_checkpoint_file()
method to retrieve a checkpoint from the NX-OS device. It should then write this
checkpoint out to a file.

Recall that the NX-OS platform requires a 'checkpoint' file for configuration
replace operations. Using this new function, retrieve a checkpoint from nxos1
and write it to the local file system.

4c. Manually copy the saved checkpoint to a new file and add an additional
loopback interface to the configuration.

4d. Create a Python script that stages a complete configuration replace operation
(using the checkpoint file that you just retrieved and modified). Once your
candidate configuration is staged perform a compare_config (diff) on the
configuration to see your pending changes. After the compare_config is complete,
then use the discard_config() method to eliminate the pending changes. Next,
perform an additional compare_config (diff) to verify that you have no pending
configuration changes. Do not actually perform the commit_config as part
of this exercise.
