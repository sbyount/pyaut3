3. Generate the following configuration output from an external Jinja2 template:
â€‹vrf definition blue
 rd 100:1
 !
 address-family ipv4
  route-target export 100:1
  route-target import 100:1
 exit-address-family
 !
 address-family ipv6
  route-target export 100:1
  route-target import 100:1
 exit-address-family

Both the IPv4 and the IPv6 address families should be controlled by Jinja2
conditionals (in other words, the entire 'address-family ipv4' section and the
entire 'address-family ipv6' sections can be dropped from the generated output
depending on the value of two variables that you pass into your
template--for example, the 'ipv4_enabled' and the 'ipv6_enabled' variables).
Additionally, both the vrf_name and the rd_number should be variables in the
template. Make sure that you control the whitespace in your output such that
the configuration looks visually correct.
