5. Dealing with Namespaces

Namespaces in XML help to differentiate between conflicting element names.

5a. Load the show_version.xml file (originally from a Cisco NX-OS device) using
the etree.fromstring() method.

Note this XML document, unlike the previous
documents, contains the document encoding information. Because the document
encoding is at the top of the file, you will need to read the file using "rb"
mode (the "b" signifies binary mode). Print out the the namespace map of this
XML object. You can accomplish this by using the .nsmap attribute of your XML object.


5b. Similar to earlier exercises, use the find() method to access the text of
the "proc_board_id" element (serial number). As this XML object contains namespace
data, you will need to use the {*} namespace wildcard in the find() method. Your
find call should look as follows:

â€‹find(".//{*}proc_board_id")

The {*} is a namespace wildcard and says to match ALL namespaces.

def read_xml(filename):
    # Read with RB attribute (binary) due to document encoding
    with open(filename, 'rb') as infile:
        return etree.fromstring(infile.read())

if __name__ == "__main__":
    filename = "show_version.xml"
    show_version = read_xml(filename)

    print('5a')
    print(show_version.nsmap)

    print('5b')
    serial_number = show_version.find(".//{*}proc_board_id").text
    print(serial_number)
